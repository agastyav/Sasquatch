# Welcome to Sasquatch!

Hello! Welcome to Our Final Project for "Fundamentals of Computer Science - 2022".

This project was made by:
-  Agastya Varanasi
-  Ashrith Velegandula
-  Joseph Bi

Currently most of the games are "Casino Themed", but we may add other types of games in the future...
  
  

# About this Project:

Within this project we have a HTML website, which has features such as a rotating slideshow which showcases the games we made. We also included a scroll button which will (when clicked on) direct you to the game area. We attempted to keep the visuals within the website, simple, yet still capable of carrying out the functions which are ncessessary. Another feature which we added was a link within a notification icon, which permenantly stays at the bottom right corner of your screen, and this link leads to a google form which allows a user to submit their own games, and allows the website to stay up to date.

The games we included are
- Slot Machine
- Blackjack
- Guess an Number
- Coin Flip
- Roulette (not russian)
- Keno (Work in Progress)

A more detailed writeup, can be found in "writeup.txt file".

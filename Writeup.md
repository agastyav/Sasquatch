Work in progress...


For our Final Project, We decided to make a HTML website, which showcases all of our Casino themed games - Somewhat like a _digital casino_.
To start of, we wanted to create a name and establish a somewhat "credible looking" homescreen, we chose the name "Sasquatch" (for reasons unknown), as our name, and then we started to work on our website.

First of, we decided to inclue a [GIF that displays a sasquatch](https://giphy.com/gifs/gjHuIwidiRcjemb1GH) from Giphy. We then made started to work on the more functional aspects of the website. We started of by adding a "alert" or "notification" button, in the bottom right corner. This button, is meant to allow the user to propose updates, and add their own games. One of the more interesting features of this button (which may seem simple, yet still required some learning) is how the  button is permenantly in the bottom right corner, no matter where you are on the rest of the page. Another interesting feature about this button is that it displays the user a popup, when hovered over.

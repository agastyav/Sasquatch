Work in progress...

   For our Final Project, We decided to make a HTML website, which showcases all of our Casino themed games - Somewhat like a _digital casino_.
To start of, we wanted to create a name and establish a somewhat "credible looking" homescreen, we chose the name "Sasquatch" (for reasons unknown), as our name, and then we started to work on our website. First of, we decided to inclue a [GIF that displays a sasquatch](https://giphy.com/gifs/gjHuIwidiRcjemb1GH) from Giphy. We then started to work on the more functional aspects of the website. 

   We started of by adding a "alert" or "notification" button, in the bottom right corner. This button, is meant to allow the user to propose updates, and add their own games. This button remains permenantly in the bottom right corner of the user's screen, no matter where he is on the website. This button also displays the user a popup when hovered over, instructing the user what its purpose is.

   Next, we added a way to display the games, the method which we chose in the end was a slideshow. In the slideshow, we have all the games, and a "welcome page" that is first seen when you scroll to that sector. Additionally, the slideshow also has arrows which will change color when you hover over them, so that you can easily see them even when you are viewing a page with a white background.
   
   The Final Thing we added within the website was a auto scroll button. Because we moved the slideshow further down the page, we had to make it at least somewhat clear that the user must scroll down to view the games, it was for that reason that we added a downwards pointing arrown which directs the user where to go. Then, to make the arrow more functional, we made it an arrow that will auto scroll to the game, when you click on it.
   
The games we added were:
-  Slot Machine
- Blackjack
- Guess an Number
- Coin Flip
- Roulette (not russian)
- Keno
- Blackjack 2.0  

For the slot machine, it works by...

Blackjack (python), works by

Guess an Number, is a pretty simple game...

In Coin Flip, we made it...

Roulette works by...

The way Keno works is...

Finally Blackjack (C) works by having a array called deck, which then is shuffledby a command I had. This deck, is then â€œdealt to the players, and the playerseach have 2 cards, currently, I only have a bot, and one other player. Then,a total for the cards is calculated, and that data is presented to theplayer. Then afterwards, the player is given the option to hit or stay. Thishappens multiple times, and eventually, the output, of the player winning,busting, and the same for the bot, is presented.

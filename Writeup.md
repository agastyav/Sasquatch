Work in progress...

   For our Final Project, We decided to make a HTML website, which showcases all of our Casino themed games - Somewhat like a _digital casino_.
To start of, we wanted to create a name and establish a somewhat "credible looking" homescreen, we chose the name "Sasquatch" (for reasons unknown), as our name, and then we started to work on our website. First of, we decided to inclue a [GIF that displays a sasquatch](https://giphy.com/gifs/gjHuIwidiRcjemb1GH) from Giphy. We then started to work on the more functional aspects of the website. 

   We started of by adding a "alert" or "notification" button, in the bottom right corner. This button, is meant to allow the user to propose updates, and add their own games. This button remains permenantly in the bottom right corner of the user's screen, no matter where he is on the website. This button also displays the user a popup when hovered over, instructing the user what its purpose is.

   Next, we added a way to display the games, the method which we chose in the end was a slideshow. In the slideshow, we have all the games, and a "welcome page" that is first seen when you scroll to that sector. Additionally, the slideshow also has arrows which will change color when you hover over them, so that you can easily see them even when you are viewing a page with a white background.
   
   The Final Thing we added within the website was a auto scroll button. Because we moved the slideshow further down the page, we had to make it at least somewhat clear that the user must scroll down to view the games, it was for that reason that we added a downwards pointing arrown which directs the user where to go. Then, to make the arrow more functional, we made it an arrow that will auto scroll to the game, when you click on it.
   
The games we added were:
-  Slot Machine
- Blackjack
- Guess an Number
- Coin Flip
- Roulette (not russian)
- Keno
- Blackjack (C)
- Slots (C)  

The slot machine works by importing the random and time python modules. In a seperate file, I made all of the possible graphics for the slot machine, and imported that into my main.py. I started off by setting the amount of money that the user starts off with. I choose a random number between 0 and 26 for the slots position. Each one of the numbers corresponds to a graphic from my graphics.py. The program asks the user how much money they want the bet and then prints out the display based on the slots position. The program checks if the position equals to 8 17 or 26(The winning positions), if so, the user wins 3x the money, if they lose, they lose the amount of money they betted. This program keeps running until the user wants to quit.

Blackjack (python), works by importing the random and time modules from the python library. Then, we generate two cards for the player and bot and print them out in the terminal. Next is the main loop setup, the while loop starts by checking if the player’s score is 21 (in which case they win and we break from the loop). Then, we take the player’s input, where they decide to hit or stay. the code starts by generating a third card for the player and then checking whether their score is less than, equal to, or greater than 21. If the score is greater than 21 then the player loses. If the score is equal to 21 then the player wins. If the score is less than 21 then the game continues and the bot plays. For the bot to play, there is a simple algorithm for the bot to make a decision that maximizes the bot’s chances of winning. In this algorithm, if the bot’s total is less than or equal to 16, the bot hits, and it then checks whether the bot’s total is less than, equal to, or greater than 21 (same as player). Else, the bot decides to stay (game continues). When the player stays, the bot needs to make a decision. We created a simple algorithm for the bot so that it hits when the bot’s total is greater than or equal to 16 or when the player’s total is greater than the bot’s. Else the bot stays, and then we compare the bot’s score with the player’s score to determine the winner.

Guess an Number, is a pretty simple game. I import random and choose a random number between 1 and 100. I give the user 8 guesses, and just write the main code in a while loop, each time checking to see if the guess equals, is greather than, or is less than the random integer. The program prints out respective statements to help the user guess the number. When the user wins they are prompted to play again, so someone can keep playing.

In Coin Flip, we made it...

Roulette works by first importing the random (used for generating the spin) and the time (used to make delays) module. Then it makes an array of numbers from 1-36, which it use to generate the spin, later in the code. it also set the initial token balance to 100 and prints it out in the terminal. Here, the code uses the sleep function in the time module, to freeze the game process for a second (to provide a game-like effect). there is then a while loop for the game process which starts by checking whether the user’s input for the grouping is valid or not. If they do not enter either of the characters that correspond to the grouping, it prints another input statement for them to enter a valid input (done with a nested while loop). Once the player enters a valid option, then they break from the nested loop and continue playing the game. The player gets to bet an amount less than or equal to their token balance if their input is greater than their token balance, then they get stuck in a nested loop which prompts them to enter a valid token balance. Once the player enters a valid amount, they continue playing the game. After choosing the grouping and placing a bet, they get to spin the wheel (which is where a random number is generated from the array of numbers from 1-36). the code then checks to see if the bet is odd or even, and also checks if the bet is high or low. Afterwards, it is calculated whether the player won or lost the bet, and a respective change is made to their balance (if the player wins, then they get their entire bet, and if they lose, they lose only 70% of the bet). Lastly, the game prompts the player to either play again or not. If the player chooses to play again then the game continues (while loop returns to the beginning). Otherwise, if the player chooses not to play again, then they exit the game (break from the loop) and the game ends.

The way Keno works is...

Blackjack (C) works by having a array called deck, which then is shuffled by a program. This deck, is then “dealt to the players, and the players each have 2 cards, currently, we only have a bot, and one other player. Then, a total for the cards is calculated, and that data is presented to the player. Then afterwards, the player is given the option to hit or stay. This happens multiple times, and eventually, the output, of the player winning, busting, and the same for the bot, is presented.

Finally Slots (C), works by first asking the user if they would like to play or not, then it will check the User's input using the strcmp function. Afterwards, if the user decides to play, it will prompt them with the same question again, allowing them to check their Balance, Exit, or countinue playing. Then the game will ask the user for how much they want to bet. Then the game will "spin" the slots, by generating 3 random numbers. Then the code will use the mod function to keep all numbers under 10. Finally, the game analyzes the results of the random numbers. If 2 of the random numbers are the same, it will subtract $5 from the user's balance (payment for spinning the slots), then it will add whatever amount the user bet, to the user's balance, along with the original amount the user bet. If none of the random numbers match, then the code will subtract the user's bet from their balance. Finally, if all 3 of the numbers match, then the user will get 20 times the numbers on the rollers, and then the $5 fee will be subtracted from their account. Finally, afterwards, the user's new balance is displayed. and the user is given the option to either exit, or to replay, if the user chooses to replay, the game will present the options stated earlier, and this will continue in a loop (and saving the progress of the user's win's and losses), until the user chooses to exit.
